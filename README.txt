Two source files are included in this submission, along with the Dataset.

The first source file, "assignment.py" is the main file with the UI ready to interact with the Recommender System. This is the client-facing code. To start, simply run the python script and the UI will create a Recommender System object from the RS class located in 'RS.py' and take you to the login page.

The second source file, 'RS.py' is the RS class file, intended to work as a separate, back-end interface with the RS object. Here, you can test and evaluate the model. To run a test on the current RS class, simply run the 'RS.py' script and it will create an instance of the RS, train itself, then test itself and produce the results.
